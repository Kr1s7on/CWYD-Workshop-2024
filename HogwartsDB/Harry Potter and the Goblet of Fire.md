# Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

## Premise

In Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts, he will be spending majority of his time in The Triwizard Tournament that the school was fortunate enough to host that year. The Durmstrangs and Beauxbatons add an unprecedented twist to the story with entirely new personalities, cultures and characters. Harry isn’t old enough to be a part of the dangerous Triwziard Tournament, as forewarned by Headmaster Dumbledore himself, but somehow that doesn’t stop him; in an interesting twist that shocked all students and professors, Harry’s name comes fluttering in flames out of the Goblet of Fire even though he didn’t put his name into said goblet. Harry must now take on the Triwizard Tournament and fight for his life to stay alive through the three gruesome challenges, although that might not be all he has to worry about.

## New Characters

- **Viktor Krum:** A famous Quidditch player for the Bulgarian national team, Krum is also a student at Durmstrang Institute, and is chosen as its champion in the Triwizard Tournament.
- **Fleur Delacour:** A student at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, Fleur is chosen as her school's champion in the Triwizard Tournament. She later becomes Bill Weasley's wife.
- **Cedric Diggory:** A student at Hogwarts and the champion for the school in the Triwizard Tournament. He is known for his fairness and courage.
- **Mad-Eye Moody (Barty Crouch Jr.):** The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, but he is actually Barty Crouch Jr., a Death Eater, who has used a Polyjuice Potion to take on Moody's appearance.
- **Barty Crouch Sr.:** A high-ranking official in the Ministry of Magic and the father of Barty Crouch Jr.

## Plot

Harry is compelled to compete in the hazardous Triwizard Tournament as an additional and underage contestant, representing Hogwarts alongside Cedric Diggory, despite not having entered himself. The competition involves three dangerous tasks: retrieving a golden egg from a dragon, retrieving something precious to them from the merpeople in the Black Lake, and navigating through a magical maze to get to the Triwizard Cup.

Throughout the tournament, Harry is plagued by recurring nightmares about a conversation between Voldemort and his servant Wormtail, indicating Voldemort's return. Simultaneously, he uncovers the truth about the mysterious Mad-Eye Moody, who is, in fact, Barty Crouch Jr., a follower of Voldemort, disguising himself using Polyjuice Potion. Crouch Jr. confesses to manipulating the events of the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort.

In the final task, Harry and Cedric touch the Triwizard Cup, which turns out to be a Portkey that transports them to a graveyard where Voldemort is waiting. Voldemort is restored to his body using Harry's blood. Cedric is killed and Harry narrowly escapes after a duel with Voldemort, bringing Cedric's body back with him. Despite his warnings about Voldemort's return, the Ministry of Magic refuse to believe Harry and Dumbledore, marking the beginning of a battle that continues into the next school year.

## Reader’s Take

Many loved this book and film because it was a turning point for Harry. It’s the first time he lost to Voldemort, and he couldn’t help it thanks to the devilish scheme set up by Voldemort. This book also plays into some deeper inter-character relationships; Ron’s envy about Harry getting into the Triwizard Tournament unfairly, Hermione going to the ball with Viktor Krum, Harry and Ron trying to find a date to the prom and more. The characters tread a lot of unexplored ground when it comes to emotions, love, jealousy, grit, trust and perseverance. The book set-up an effective return of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named whose real-life presence shocked Harry to the core. Harry was pushed into dangerous and foreign circumstances and tried his best to stay at the surface while forces beyond his control tugged him hard. This setback for all protagonist characters sets up a perfect comeback arc that follows in the consecutive sequels.
