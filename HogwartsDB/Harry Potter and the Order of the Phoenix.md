## Reader’s Take

Many felt that the 'Order of the Phoenix' is a exciting instalment in the Harry Potter series, it dives deep into the darker and more twisted aspects of the famous wizarding world. Friendships and loyalty are tested evermore so in this chapter, Harry's closest friends took the leap of faith, and stood strong on his side, against the world. Harry's world had a interesting turn of events when he found an interesting alliance with the Order of the Phoenix, a group dedicated to fighting against Voldemort. Another group formed in this journey is, Dumbledore's Army, where their mission is to train the students in defensive magic, to upskill them and prepare for the incoming war.

Not the entire story is filled with heartwarming friendship stories and jam-packed action moments, in this chapter came a time where Harry faces a devastating loss and ends up grappling with grief and guilt. Nonetheless, we see how the gang emerge stronger and more determined than before to continue this uphill battle against Voldemort, demonstrating the resilience of their friendship and commitment to each other.
